## Frontend Challenge

---

## Requirements
- User can list expenses
- User can add a comment on an expense
- User can filter on expenses (client side filters)
- User can add a receipt image on an expense

---

From the requirements, I gathered that our objective is to make it simple and
easy for users to find expenses.

---

To achieve this simple objective
- the design has to be simple
- the design has to be intuitive and familiar
- the design has to be unobstrusive

---

## Solution / Stack
- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org) - Frontend Framework
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) - State Management
- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) - UI library
- [Nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/) - Web Application Framework

---

## Process
1. Design (Mockup > UI Design)
2. Collect requirements & pair with libraries
3. Setup project
4. Build

---

## Challenges / Difficulties
- Design
- Filters

---

## Gotchas
- Pagination / Duplicate content

---
